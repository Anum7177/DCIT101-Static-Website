		<h2>Classification of Flowers</h2>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="c-col">
				<h2>Kingdom Plantae</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>They are multicellular eukaryotes.</li>
						<li>Their cells have cell walls, large vacuoles but lack centrosomes. The cell wall is usually made up of cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose.</li>
						<li>They exhibit a diverse mode of nutrition. Most have chlorophyll a and b, and other pigments, thus they are typically photosynthetic or autotrophs. Some, like insectivorous plants, are heterotrophs.</li>
						<li>Plants are non-motile, meaning that they are usually fixed in one place.</li>
						<li>They have chloroplasts which is an organelle that evolved from single-celled algae. They require mineral salts, light, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. They obtain these resources from the environment. Light and carbon dioxide are essential for the process of photosynthesis to take place.Most reserve their food material in the form of starch.</li>
						<li>Most reproduce through sexual, asexual, and vegetative means. Agents such as wind, air, and insects aid in this process.</li>
						<li>Some members of kingdom Plantae exhibit alternation of generations, i.e., sporophyte phase and gametophyte phase.</li>
					</ul>
				
			</div>
			<div class="c-col">
				<h2>Phylum Angiospermophyta</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Angiosperms have small pollen grains that spread genetic information from flower to flower. These grains are much smaller than the gametophytes, or reproductive cells, used by non-flowering plants. This small size allows the process of fertilization to occur quicker in the flowers of angiosperms and makes them more efficient at reproducing.</li>
						<li>All angiosperms have stamens. Stamens are the reproductive structures found in flowers that produce the pollen grains that carry the male genetic information.</li>
						<li>Angiosperms have much smaller female reproductive parts than non-flowering plants, allowing them to produce seeds more quickly.</li>
						<li>Angiosperms have carpels that enclose developing seeds that may turn into a fruit.</li>
						<li>A great advantage for angiosperms is the production of endosperm. Endosperm is a material that forms after fertilization and serves as a highly nutritional food source for the developing seed and seedling.</li>
						<li>Angiosperms come in a variety of forms. Some common examples of angiosperms include magnolia trees, roses, tulips, and tomatoes.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Class Monocot/Dicot</h2>
				<h3>Monocots</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Embryo with single cotyledon</li>
					<li>Pollen with single furrow or pore</li>
					<li>Flower parts in multiples of three</li>
					<li>Major leaf veins parallel</li>
					<li>Stem vascular bundles scattered</li>
					<li>Roots are adventitious</li>
					<li>Secondary growth absent</li>

		<h2>Types of Flowers</h2>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="types-col">
				<img src="Picture1.jpg">
				<h3>African Marigold </h3>
				<p>Sometimes known as the Big Marigold, this bushy annual is prized for its large double flowers. Each blossom measures two to four inches across and comes in orange, yellow, and white shades. They are long blooming from early summer until the first frost, and they need minor assistance to thrive. They are ideal for beds, borders, and patio pots. </p> 
			</div>
			<div class="types-col">
				<img src="Picture5.jpg">
				<h3>African Violet</h3>
				<p>African Violets are one of the most popular plants for indoor gardens. Most species naturally live in the mountains, usually under the cover of other plants. Because of this, they require moderate temperatures and light, which can easily be found and controlled inside of homes. However, some indoor gardeners shy away from growing them because their care can be intimidating. These plants come in almost every colour and have a frilly or fringed texture to the petals. They will bloom everyday if in bright and dependable lighting. The foliage is typically green or variegated, with a slight fuzz in texture.</p> 
			</div>
			<div class="types-col">
				<img src="picture.jpg">
				<h3>American Lotus </h3>
				<p>This might not be as popular as the Sacred Lotus that is more often seen in cultivation. But these flowers provide a blanket of elegance thanks to their pure white petals and a yellow centre. They grow up to 12 inches across and are a sight to behold. It is a marginal aquatic perennial that also produces large umbrella-like leaves. They are native to eastern North America. </p>
			</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="types-col">
				<img src="Picture3.jpg">
				<h3>African Daisy</h3>
				<p>This is an excellent choice for anyone looking for bright, beautiful blooms all through summer into fall. There are around 70 species of Osteospermum and an increasing number of cultivars, and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) lists about 900 varieties. One stem carries a single flower, comprising a central disc surrounded by bright petals. The petals of some species are variegated in colour, offering the most stunning bloom. Most petals are flat, but some produce spoon-shaped petals, such as the Osteospermum Sunny Philip. Depending on what zone you live in, distinct species can be annuals or perennials. </p> 
			</div>
			<div class="types-col">
				<img src="Picture6.jpg">
				<h3>Alpenrose</h3>
				<p>This upright evergreen shrub produces glossy, dark-green leaves and clusters of tubulars rose pink to crimson flowers. It blooms in the early summer and grows in a compact and upright habit. The Alpenrose can grow up to five feet high, looking great in the rear of borders and at the side of water gardens. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is hardy in zones four to nine. </p> 
			</div>
			<div class="types-col">
				<img src="Picture7.jpg">
				<h3>Amaryllis</h3>
				<p>This is a popular bulb given as a gift around the Christmas holidays, thanks to their large, brightly coloured blooms supported by large stems. There are five types of Amaryllis: large flowering, double flowering, small flowering, cybister, and trumpet. The most popular is the large flowering, single flower Amaryllis, which grows up to ten inches tall. The bigger the bulb, the more stems, and flowers they produce. They may be planted outdoors (deep south only) and are easy to bring into bloom. Amaryllis Clown is an award-winning old favourite that is reminiscent of candy canes. </p>

		<h2>Benefits of Flowers</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Flowers Can Increase Creativity, Innovation, and Productivity.</b>
				Sitting in an office all day can be difficult. It’s easy to get distracted and feel all your creative energy dissipate. Fortunately, placing a vase of flowers in your office can increase productivity and innovation.
				One study investigated the effects a bouquet of roses had on office workers. One group of workers was presented with pink roses and the control group did not receive any flowers. Researchers then measured both groups’ various mood states.
				Workers who looked at the flowers had lower levels of confusion, fatigue, and tension-anxiety. They also had higher levels of vigour.
				While this study didn’t directly measure creativity and productivity, the ability to focus and feel relaxed often helps with productivity and creativity.
				</li>
				<li><b>Flowers Can Help You Focus.</b>
				Many modern jobs require long periods of directed attention. Think of tasks such as reading a manuscript and analysing data.
				While this attention is crucial to a job well done, it is also draining. That’s why you may find your focus waning as the day goes on.
				The good news is that there’s an easy way for you to restore some of your ability to focus. Spending time with natural elements like flowers can help you recover from attention fatigue.
				The next time you’re having a hard time concentrating, go for a walk in the garden or spend a few minutes arranging a bouquet. When you return to your work, you’ll likely realize your ability to focus has improved.
				</li>
				<li><b>Flowers Can Help You Sleep.</b>
				People often applaud lavender essential oil for its ability to improve sleep. Multiple research studies support that inhaling this essential oil can help you sleep.
				Two groups of college students were instructed to practice good sleep hygiene. One of these groups was given a lavender essential oil patch, and the other was given a blank patch. The group who inhaled lavender essential oil reported better sleep quality and awakened feeling more refreshed.
				Other studies show that lavender essential oil can improve sleep quality in postpartum mothers and hemodialysis patients.
				Being around and caring for flowers can also improve sleep. Interacting with flowers and other plants can lower stress and anxiety, allowing you to drift off to sleep.
				</li>
				<li><b>Flowers Can Increase Energy.</b>
				Feeling a little down or tired? We’ve all been there. Fortunately, flowers can help increase energy and lower fatigue.
				Simply spending time working with or looking at flowers has been shown to lower fatigue and increase energy levels. Adding some flowering plants to your office could be a great way to provide a boost of mid-day energy.
				</li>
				<li><b>Flowers Can Help Clean the Air.</b>
				Thanks to the famous NASA Clean Air Study, it’s well known that plants can help clean the air. In case you’re not familiar with this study, we’ll cover the basics.
				Since astronauts are often in enclosed spaces, NASA wanted to test if plants could remove chemicals from the air. Researchers chose a list of plants and chemicals then got to work.
				They placed plants in small chambers and measured chemical concentrations over time. Results showed that almost all plants removed significant amounts of benzene and formaldehyde from the air.
				If you’re wondering if these sealed chamber experiments relate to real life, you’re not alone. Since the NASA study, researchers have conducted many more experiments involving plants and air pollutants.
				One study investigated fourteen different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor offices. Results showed that when these compounds rose above 100ppb, plants reduced loads to safe levels.
				Most of these studies relate to potted plants rather than cut flowers. So, if you’re looking to decrease indoor air pollution, opt for flowering houseplants rather than a bouquet.
				</li>
				<li>.<b>Flower Growing Connects You to the Natural World.</b>
				As we spend more time on screens and less time outdoors, it can be difficult to connect to nature. Flower growing provides a fun and easy way to reconnect to the natural world.
				If your garden is where you go for peace, you’re not alone. And there’s research to back up why spending time in a garden is so soothing and satisfying.
				Studies show that gardening benefits everyone, from children to the elderly. Spending time in a garden reduces feelings of stress, anger, and sadness.
				Gardening can also help you feel more rooted in a place and give you a sense of responsibility. These benefits may also be beneficial for older adults dealing with dementia.
				</li>
				<li><b>Flowers May Help You Physically Heal.</b>
				Flowers are often used as a component of horticultural therapy. This type of therapy is used to help patients dealing with physical and mental ailments.
				People who receive horticultural therapy often see improved moods, which increases the body’s ability to heal itself.
				One study examined the effect of horticultural therapy on people in a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program. After completing one session, patients showed improved mood as well as decreased heart rate. This shows that flowers can improve both mental and physical health.
				Another study examined hospital patients who were recovering from appendix removal surgery. Some of these patients had plants and flowers in their room, while others did not.
				Researchers monitored the participants’ blood pressure and heart rate as well as pain intensity, anxiety, and fatigue.
				Results showed that patients with plants in their rooms experienced less pain intensity and pain distress. This was especially true on the third-day post-surgery. Patients with plants in their rooms also reported less anxiety and fatigue.
				So why is this? It might relate to mental outlook. Compared to patients in bare rooms, patients with plants in their rooms reported their rooms were more calming, attractive, and colourful.
				The next time a friend or a family member falls ill, remember these studies. Sending them flowers not only shows you care, but it can also speed up healing.
				</li>
				<li><b>Flowers Can Help Heal the Common Cold.</b>
				As you know by now, looking at flowers can help relieve stress and improve sleep. This will help your body relax and give it a better chance to fight off the common cold.
				Additionally, numerous flowering plants have antiviral properties. While researchers didn’t always look at the viruses that cause the common cold, they did find out that medicinal plants could help fight off other viruses.
				Plus, some flowers may shorten the length and lessen the severity of the common cold. Echinacea can reduce the length of a cold by a few hours and make you feel a little less sick.

			<h2>Information about Flowers</h2>
			<p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.</p>
			<p>The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators. 
			Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
			In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to the environment, and as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft, religion, medicine, and as a source of food.
